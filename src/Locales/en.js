    "WHAT DO WE DO ?",
    "GROWING TREES",
    "As the trees grow, photosynthesis reduces carbon dioxide in the air by storing it in the wood, roots, and soil. Our partner, iTERAKA, takes all the actions necessary to turn this carbon into carbon credits and then sells them on the carbon market. TERAKA Farmers receive a prepayment every year and will also receive 70% of the profits from the sale of the carbon credits.",

Profit Share is created when iTERAKA sells carbon credits to another person or company, and iTERAKA shares 70% of the profit from the sale with the TERAKA Small Groups.",
    "Creating a Carbon Credit",
    "To create a carbon credit, a TERAKA Cluster Servant will count the trees in each grove, measuring the circumference of the tree trunk, and writing down the tree species, and how close the trees are planted together.  This information is then added to the TERAKA database. iTERAKA uses the information to create a carbon credit.

These comments should be specific and refer to something the Leader did or said.  Think of it as something that a “fly on the wall” would see or hear.  It should not be a general comment like “the Leader did a good job.”  Instead, it should be a specific comment like “the Leader kept time, smiled, and encouraged all Small Group members to speak.”",
    "Why Practice Kujengana ?",
