    "Who is TERAKA?",
    "TERAKA is made up of farmers who volunteer to join the TERAKA community. They value education, agricultural knowledge and helping the environment. Many TERAKA farmers live in arid areas that suffer from deforestation, land degradation, drought and food scarcity. TERAKA is made up of small groups. We work together to develop best practices and improve our farms and environment.",
    "By planting trees, farmers in TERAKA get firewood, building materials, fruits and nuts, and medicine. They also improve the soil, protect their farms from flooding, improve the water in their communities and help fight climate change.",
    "TERAKA farmers fund the program by very accurately measuring the amount of carbon dioxide their farming practices and trees have removed from the atmosphere. Working with the Clean Air Action Corporation (CAAC) to accurately measure their results and transparent, they are able to enter the global carbon market.",
    "When a small group works together, it can accomplish a lot. When thousands of small groups work to improve their farms and communities, they can help change the world! All TERAKA members live by the values of TERAKA. Then you will discover these important values.",
    "TERAKA Values",
    "TERAKA is a community of farmers who have come together to improve the lives of their families, their communities and the planet",
    "More than 130,000 farmers are maintaining approximately 23 million living trees in India, Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda.",
    "TERAKA's values play important roles in the success of the program.",
    "We are honest.",

    "Farmers join TERAKA for the community, education, increased agricultural knowledge and to participate in the carbon business.",
    "We develop and use best practices",
    "TERAKA farmers develop and share information on agricultural conservation, forestry, nutrition, and sustainability activities. We share these best practices with all Small Groups.",
    "We do the work ourselves in Small Groups",
    "The foundation of the TERAKA program is the Small Groups. Between 6 and 12 farmers meet weekly to share best practices, support each other and hold each other accountable.",
    "We use our head and our hands",
    "We know how to work hard with our head and our hands. Our commitment to TERAKA values means we do things the right way, not the hard way.",
    "What are we doing? ",
    "Grow trees",
    "Farmers join TERAKA as part of a small group of 6-12 people to plant trees around their homes, farms, streams, schools, roads and churches. Trees provide shade, reduce erosion, improve the soil and encourage the growth of native shrubs and grasses. Trees also produce fruits and nuts, medicine, fodder for livestock, firewood and building materials.",
    "As trees grow, photosynthesis reduces carbon dioxide in the air by storing it in wood, roots and soil. Our partner, Clean Air Action Corporation (CAAC), is taking all the necessary steps to transform this carbon into carbon credits and then sells them on the carbon market. TERAKA Farmers receive a prepayment each year and will also receive 70% of the profits from the sale of the carbon credits.",
    "LEADERS DEVELOPMENT",
    "We also develop leaders. Using 'Rotating Leadership', all TERAKA farmers learn how to lead their small group. Some TERAKA farmers choose to be trained as cluster servants who matter and monitor the growth of their each tree so that CAAC's calculations of carbon credits are honest and accurate. These results are on the website www.teraka.org so that people around the world can see our activities transparently.",
    "SHARING BEST PRACTICES",
    "We develop and share best practices in conservation agriculture, forestry, health (including HIV/AIDS) and sustainable development activities. TERAKA farmers share these best practices with all small groups. We have newsletters, monthly local cluster meetings and regional seminars where we share the best practices we have developed.",
    "What are we doing?",
    "We plant different species of trees to create a better environment",

As TERAKA trees can generate money for carbon, there are some additional rules to follow to participate in carbon trading.",
    "Good training!",
    "The benefits of planting trees",
    "Here are the benefits of planting trees, such as medicine and soil stability.",
    "Why is tree planting important?",
    "Planting trees restores deforested areas",
    "Forests are home to a variety of plant and animal species, and planting trees helps maintain biodiversity.",
    "Planting trees helps stop soil erosion and landslides",
    "Tree roots help stabilize the soil and reduce erosion caused by wind and flooding. Planting trees on the sides reduces the risk of landslides.",
    "Trees improve the quality of the soil around them, helping crops grow better through agroforestry",
    "With agroforestry, trees are grown among crops and pastures. Fallen leaves from trees help improve the soil by adding nutrients such as nitrogen.",
    "Trees provide fruits and nuts that can be used for income and nutrition",
    "Many tree species produce fruit, such as avocado and mangoes, or nuts, such as macadamia. These can be sold or used to feed the family.",
    "In windy areas, trees can be planted around structures as a windbreak",
    "Trees create a natural wind block reducing soil loss. When planted around structures, trees can protect buildings and structures from the clothesline.",
    "Some trees provide medicine.",
    "Certain species of trees, such as old cassia or rat's-tail, contain useful medicinal properties.",
    "Trees provide timber, energy and poles",
    "In accordance with TERAKA's best practices, wood can be sustainably harvested for personal use on the farm.",
    "Planting trees beautifies your field.",
    "Trees not only provide economic, agricultural and environmental benefits: they are also beautiful to look at!",
    "Trees help fight climate change.",
    "Climate change leads to droughts, floods and erratic rainfall. Trees improve the climate by removing carbon from the atmosphere.",
    "What does it mean to plant trees with TERAKA?",
    "TERAKA members choose which trees to plant on their farms. Native trees and fruit trees are often good choices.",
    "However, planting trees for TERAKA is subject to certain requirements.",
    "First, to be considered a TERAKA tree, a tree must be planted after joining the TERAKA program. Trees that are already growing are not considered TERAKA trees.",
    "The tree must reach at least 2 meters in height",
    "1 year",
    "60 years",
    "The grove must remain alive for at least 60 years",
    "Saplings that have not yet reached 2 meters in height may be TERAKA trees, but they are not yet eligible for carbon currency. However, these trees are eligible for prepayments.",
    "TERAKA trees must be planted with a distance of 2 meters. To capture carbon, a tree needs space to grow widely.",
    "2 meters",
    "Trees must be planted at a distance of 2 meters from each other in order to benefit from the carbon currency.",
    "TERAKA Farmers in TERAKA may plant trees less than 2 meters for other purposes, such as firewood. These trees would not earn carbon currency.",
    "Trees must be planted on your own land or with the owner's permission.",
    "While not required, TERAKA participants are encouraged to build an elevated seedbed to help cultivate the seedlings. These tree seedlings can then be planted and used to generate additional income.",
    "Conclusion: TERAKA and tree planting",
    "Congratulations! You now have a better understanding of what it means to plant trees with TERAKA! Now is the time to take action! You can start planting trees on your farm for TERAKA.",

    "What is the carbon cycle and how is planting trees part of it?",
    "How can trees contribute to the fight against climate change?",
    "What is the carbon market and how does it relate to tree planting?",
    "What is Carbon?",
    "Carbon is all around us, but we can't see it, touch it, or taste it so what is it?",
    "The following section explains what carbon is and how it is essential to all life on Earth. You will also learn why burning fuel harms the environment and contributes to climate change. Understanding this relationship is important to understand the TERAKA program and why tree planting is so important to everything TERAKA does.",
    "Carbon is the building block of all living things. It surrounds us and is part of us: ",
    "The trees that give us shade are made of carbon",
    "The animals we raise are made of carbon",
    "The vegetables we grow are made of carbon",
    "Even you and I are made of carbon",
    "The fuels we use every day are also made up of carbon: fuels like gasoline and firewood for cooking.",
    "When we burn carbon-based fuels, we produce smoke and exhaust fumes that dirty the air we breathe and blacken our tin roofs.",
    "The combustion of carbon-based fuels also releases carbon dioxide (CO2) into the air. When CO2 enters the atmosphere, it traps heat, which warms the planet. This is why CO2 is called a greenhouse gas and contributes to climate change.",
    "TERAKA farmers remove CO2 from the atmosphere by planting trees, thus combating the effects of climate change.",
    "What is the carbon cycle?",
    "Now that you know what carbon is and how important it is to life on Earth, it's important to understand the carbon cycle.",
    "We will explain the carbon cycle and show how TERAKA farmers are helping to complete the carbon cycle by planting trees.",
    "Carbon is present everywhere on Earth. It regulates the Earth's temperature, is the basis of all floods and is a major source of fuel. Carbon is the basis of all life on Earth. Carbon is found in our atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide or CO2. We can't see it, taste it or smell it, but it's all around us.",

    "How TERAKA earns money through the carbon credit business",
    "Farmers in a small TERAKA group participate in the global carbon credit market. This section explains how TERAKA farmers create money from the carbon credit market.",
    "TERAKA and the Carbon Credit business",
    "The carbon credit activity is how CAAC receives funds to run the TERAKA program",
    "TERAKA farmers join a small group with the aim of helping the environment",
    "The small TERAKA group signs a contract with Clean Air Action Corporation (CAAC), the company that manages the TERAKA program",
    "This contract is called Greenhouse Gas Contract or GHG Contract",
    "As part of the GHG contract, the Small Group undertakes to plant trees and the CAAC agrees to share 70% of the profits from the carbon credits.",
    "TERAKA Small Groups Keep Trees Alive.",
    "A TERAKA Cluster agent will come to count the trees and measure their growth.",
    "This allows the CAAC to calculate how much carbon the trees have taken up from the air.",
    "CAAC engages third-party auditors to ensure the accuracy of this measurement.",
    "CAAC creates a carbon credit from the amount of carbon that TERAKA trees have removed from the air.",
    "Companies buy this carbon credit from the CAAC",
    "The CAAC shares the profits from the sale of carbon credits with the farmers of TERAKA.",
    "This is called profit sharing.",
    "This is how TERAKA Small Groups benefit from the carbon business.",
    "Every TERAKA farmer can participate in the carbon market if they meet the required conditions.",
    "Carbon prepayments",
    "At first, TERAKA trees will be too small to create a carbon credit. Until the TERAKA tree grows large enough, small TERAKA groups will receive an advance payment of $0.02 per tree per year to maintain the tree growth.",
    "Carbon Profit Sharing",
    "When the tree is large enough and the small group meets all of the eligibility requirements, the TERAKA small group receives profit sharing. Profit sharing is created when CAAC sells carbon credits to another person or company, and that the CAAC shares 70% of the profits from the sale with the small TERAKA groups.",
    "Creation of a carbon credit",
    "To create a carbon credit, a TERAKA servant will count the trees in each grove, measuring the circumference of the trunk, noting the species of the tree and the proximity of the trees to each other. This information is then added to the database TERAKA data. The CAAC uses this information to create a carbon credit. This carbon credit is then sold to another person or company wishing to help the environment.",
    "Other Benefits of TERAKA",
    "TERAKA farmers create many other benefits besides carbon currency.",
    "Here are some of those benefits:",
    "Improved stoves",

    "Improved stoves are good for your health, because you breathe in less smoke.",
    "Conservation Farming",
    "Conservation agriculture helps farmers get more crops",
    "Conservation agriculture allows you to get more crops even when there is little rain",
    "TERAKA Farmers practice conservation agriculture, such as digging holes filled with compost manure to plant trees.",
    "Manure composting training",
    "TERAKA farmers receive training on how to make compost. This allows farmers to get better yields, help the environment and avoid buying fertilizers.",

    "The person with accountability The person with accountability reminds the small group of their past and present responsibilities and commitments. The person with accountability becomes the co-leader at the next meeting.",
    "Rotating Leadership",
    "Leadership rotation is a TERAKA best practice for small groups. Leadership is rotated at each (weekly) meeting, with the co-lead becoming the leader, the person with accountability becoming the co-lead, and a new person charged with the responsibility being elected.",
    "Leadership alternates between men and women at each level of TERAKA. This means that if the current responsible person is a man, the next one should be a woman. Thus, leadership always alternates between men and women.",
    "The Benefits of Rotating Leadership",
    "Here are some of the benefits of leadership rotation:",
    "Each person has the opportunity to serve as a leader.",
